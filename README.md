## Aion Specturm: Emodo App

#### Project Description: Aims & Background

“EMODO” – an app that helps children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) improve social-emotional skills. We believe that having awareness of their emotions and being able to label those emotions correctly helps them signal for help when required, and we provide coping strategies for negative emotions. Families with children on the spectrum often find themselves struggling with time and financial constraints, which leads to a low quality of life.

As a result of using the app kids will learn some social strategie, emotions and context behind them as well as provide them tools to cope with them. For their parents, carers and practitioners we will provide various statistics on the app usage.

The main features of this app are two games:
1) Game#1-Quiz:guessinganemotionthatisshown
2) Game #2 - CopyCat: coping emotion shown on the random picture
